## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

Use flexbox to centre content in the middle of the page. For pulling something out of normal flow, you can use absolute position method of centring. But otherwise, there's no need. Also, I should always try to think systematically. For instance, structure the HTML going from the outside to the inside of the content using semantic HTML and as few divs as reasonable. Also, use padding when you want to push something further from its border, don't just use margin because you feel like it. There are many clear situations in my opinion. 

### Continued development

I need to practice making layouts. It should've been immediately obvious that flexbox was ideal here.
